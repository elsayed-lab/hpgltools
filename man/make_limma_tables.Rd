\title{Writes out the results of a limma search using toptable().}
\usage{
make_limma_tables(
  fit = NULL,
  adjust = "BH",
  n = 0,
  coef = NULL,
  annot_df = NULL,

\arguments{
\item{fit}{Result from lmFit()/eBayes()}

\item{adjust}{Pvalue adjustment chosen.}

\item{n}{Number of entries to report, 0 says do them all.}

\item{coef}{Which coefficients/contrasts to report, NULL says do them all.}

\item{annot_df}{Optional data frame including annotation information to
include with the tables.}

\item{intercept}{Intercept model?}
}
\value{
List of data frames comprising the toptable output for each
 coefficient, I also added a qvalue entry to these toptable() outputs.

However, this will do a couple of things to make one's life easier:
1.  Make a list of the output, one element for each comparison of the contrast matrix
2.  Write out the toptable() output in separate .csv files and/or sheets in excel
3.  Since I have been using qvalues a lot for other stuff, add a column for them.
