\title{Given a named vector of fun regions, make a dataframe which
includes putative primers and the spec strings for expected
variants.}
\usage{
choose_sequence_regions(
  long_variant_vector,
  max_primer_length = 45,
  topn = NULL,
  bin_width = 600,
  genome = NULL,
  target_temp = 58,
  min_gc_prop = 0.25,
  max_nmer_run = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{long_variant_vector}{variant-based set of putative regions with variants
between conditions of interest.}

\item{max_primer_length}{given this length as a start, whittle down
to a hopefully usable primer size.}

\item{topn}{Choose this number of variant regions from the rather
larger set of possibilities..}

\item{bin_width}{Separate the genome into chunks of this size when
hunting for primers, this size will therefore be the approximate
PCR amplicon length.}

\item{genome}{(BS)Genome to search.}

\item{target_temp}{PCR temperature to attempt to match.}

\item{min_gc_prop}{Cutoff for minimum required GC content.}

\item{max_nmer_run}{Maximum run of the same nucleotide allowed.}
}
\description{
This function came out of our TMRC2 work and seeks to provide an
initial set of potential PCR primers which are able to distinguish
between different aspects of the data.  In the actual data, we were
looking for differences between the zymodemes 2.2 and 2.3.
