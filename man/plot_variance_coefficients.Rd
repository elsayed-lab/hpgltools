\description{
I want to look at the (B)CV of some data with respect to condition/batch/whatever.
This function should make that possible, with some important caveats.  The
most appropriate metric  is actually the biological coefficient of variation
as calculated by DESeq2/EdgeR; but the metrics I am currently taking are the
simpler and less appropriate CV(sd/mean) and QCD(q3-q1/q3+q1).
