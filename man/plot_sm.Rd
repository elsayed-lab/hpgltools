\item{method}{Correlation or distance method to use.}

\item{plot_legend}{Include a legend on the side?}

\item{expt_names}{Use pretty names for the samples?}

\item{label_chars}{Maximum number of characters before abbreviating sample names.}

\value{
ggplot of the standard median something
 among the samples.  This will also write to an
 open device.  The resulting plot measures the median correlation of
 each sample among its peers.  It notes 1.5* the interquartile range
 among the samples and makes a horizontal line at that correlation
 coefficient.  Any sample which falls below this line is considered
 for removal because it is much less similar to all of its peers.

\description{
This was written by a mix of Kwame Okrah <kokrah at gmail dot com>, Laura
Dillon <dillonl at umd dot edu>, and Hector Corrada Bravo <hcorrada at umd dot edu>
I reimplemented it using ggplot2 and tried to make it a little more flexible.
The general idea is to take the pairwise correlations/distances of the
samples, then take the medians, and plot them.  This version of the plot is
no longer actually a dotplot, but a point plot, but who is counting?
