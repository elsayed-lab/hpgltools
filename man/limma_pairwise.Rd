\title{Set up a model matrix and set of contrasts for pairwise comparisons using
voom/limma.}

limma_pairwise(
  input = NULL,
  conditions = NULL,
  batches = NULL,
  model_cond = TRUE,
  model_batch = TRUE,
  model_intercept = FALSE,
  alt_model = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Dataframe/vector or expt class containing count tables,
normalization state, etc.}

\item{conditions}{Factor of conditions in the experiment.}

\item{batches}{Factor of batches in the experiment.}

\item{model_cond}{Include condition in the model?}

\item{model_batch}{Include batch in the model?  If this is a character
instead of a logical, then it is passed to all_adjusers() to attempt to find
model parameters which describe surrogate variables in the data.}

\item{model_intercept}{Perform a cell-means or intercept model? A little more
difficult for me to understand.  I have tested and get the same answer
either way.}

\item{alt_model}{Separate model matrix instead of the normal condition/batch.}

\item{extra_contrasts}{Some extra contrasts to add to the list.
This can be pretty neat, lets say one has conditions A,B,C,D,E
and wants to do (C/B)/A and (E/D)/A or (E/D)/(C/B) then use this
with a string like: "c_vs_b_ctrla = (C-B)-A, e_vs_d_ctrla = (E-D)-A,
de_vs_cb = (E-D)-(C-B),"}

\item{annot_df}{Data frame for annotations.}

\item{libsize}{I've recently figured out that libsize is far more important
than I previously realized.  Play with it here.}

\item{which_voom}{Try out different invocations of voom.}

\item{limma_method}{And different invocations of limma itself.}

\item{limma_robust}{Pass along the robust args for limma?}

\item{voom_norm}{Use a specific normalization for voom?}

\item{limma_trend}{Include a trendline in the limma plot?}

\item{force}{Force data which may not be appropriate for limma into it?}

\item{keepers}{Choose a set of contrasts instead of all.}

\item{...}{Use the elipsis parameter to feed options to write_limma().}
}
\value{
List including the following information:
 macb = the mashing together of condition/batch so you can look at it
 macb_model = The result of calling model.matrix(~0 + macb)
 macb_fit = The result of calling lmFit(data, macb_model)
 voom_result = The result from voom()
 voom_design = The design from voom (redundant from voom_result, but convenient)
 macb_table = A table of the number of times each condition/batch pairing happens
 cond_table = A table of the number of times each condition appears (the
  denominator for the identities)
 batch_table = How many times each batch appears
 identities = The list of strings defining each condition by itself
 all_pairwise = The list of strings defining all the pairwise contrasts
 contrast_string = The string making up the makeContrasts() call
 pairwise_fits = The result from calling contrasts.fit()
 pairwise_comparisons = The result from eBayes()
 limma_result = The result from calling write_limma()
}
