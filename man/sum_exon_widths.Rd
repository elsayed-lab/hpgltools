\title{Given a data frame of exon counts and annotation information, sum the exons.}
\usage{
sum_exon_widths(
  data = NULL,
  gff = NULL,
  annotdf = NULL,
  parent = "Parent",
  child = "row.names"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Count tables of exons.}

\item{gff}{Gff filename.}

\item{annotdf}{Dataframe of annotations (probably from load_gff_annotations).}

\item{parent}{Column from the annotations with the gene names.}

\item{child}{Column from the annotations with the exon names.}
}
\value{
List of 2 data frames, counts and lengths by summed exons.
}
\description{
This function will merge a count table to an annotation table by
the child column. It will then sum all rows of exons by parent gene
and sum the widths of the exons. Finally it will return a list
containing a df of gene lengths and summed counts.
