\title{Gather information about principle components.}
\usage{
pca_information(
  expt,
  expt_design = NULL,
  expt_factors = c("condition", "batch"),
  num_components = NULL,
  plot_pcas = FALSE,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expt}{Data to analyze (usually exprs(somedataset)).}

\item{expt_design}{Dataframe describing the experimental design, containing
columns with useful information like the conditions, batches, number of
cells, whatever...}

\item{expt_factors}{Character list of experimental conditions to query for
R^2 against the fast.svd of the data.}

\item{num_components}{Number of principle components to compare the design
factors against. If left null, it will query the same number of components
as factors asked for.}

\item{plot_pcas}{Plot the set of PCA plots for every pair of PCs queried.}

\item{...}{Extra arguments for the pca plotter}
}
\value{
a list of fun pca information:
 svd_u/d/v: The u/d/v parameters from fast.svd
 rsquared_table: A table of the rsquared values between each factor and principle component
 pca_variance: A table of the pca variances
 pca_data: Coordinates for a pca plot
 pca_cor: A table of the correlations between the factors and principle components
 anova_fstats: the sum of the residuals with the factor vs without (manually calculated)
 anova_f: The result from performing anova(withfactor, withoutfactor), the F slot
 anova_p: The p-value calculated from the anova() call
 anova_sums: The RSS value from the above anova() call
 cor_heatmap: A heatmap from recordPlot() describing pca_cor.
}
\description{
Calculate some information useful for generating PCA plots.
pca_information seeks to gather together interesting information
to make principle component analyses easier, including: the results
from (fast.)svd, a table of the r^2 values, a table of the
variances in the data, coordinates used to make a pca plot for an
arbitrarily large set of PCs, correlations and fstats between
experimental factors and the PCs, and heatmaps describing these
relationships.  Finally, it will provide a plot showing how much of
the variance is provided by the top-n genes and (optionally) the
set of all PCA plots with respect to one another. (PCx vs. PCy)
