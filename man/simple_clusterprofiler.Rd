analyses.}

ontologies.}

expressed categories.}

\item{permutations}{How many permutations for GSEA-ish analyses?}

\item{min_groupsize}{Minimum size of an ontology before it is included.}

\description{
The new version of clusterProfiler has a bunch of new toys.  However, it is
more stringent in terms of input in that it now explicitly expects to receive
annotation data in terms of a orgdb object.  This is mostly advantageous, but
will probably cause some changes in the other ontology functions in the near
future.  This function is an initial pass at making something similar to my
previous 'simple_clusterprofiler()' but using these new toys.
