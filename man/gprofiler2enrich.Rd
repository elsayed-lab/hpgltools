\arguments{
\item{retlst}{Output from simple_gprofiler()}

\item{ontology}{Category type to extract, currently only GO?}

\item{cutoff}{Use a p-value cutoff to get only the significant
categories?}

\item{organism}{Set the orgdb organism name?}

\item{padjust_method}{what it says on the tin.}

\value{
enrichResult object ready to pass to things like dotplot.

The same 'enrich' datastructure produced by clusterProfiler.

\description{
I would like to use the various clusterProfiler plots more easily.
Therefore I figured it would be advantageous to coerce the various
outputs from gprofiler and friends into the datastructure produced by
clusterProfiler.
