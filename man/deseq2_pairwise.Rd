\arguments{
\item{input}{Dataframe/vector or expt class containing data, normalization state, etc.}

\item{conditions}{Factor of conditions in the experiment.}

\item{batches}{Factor of batches in the experiment.}

\item{model_cond}{Is condition in the experimental model?}

\item{model_batch}{Is batch in the experimental model?}

\item{model_intercept}{Use an intercept model?}

\item{alt_model}{Provide an arbitrary model here.}

\item{extra_contrasts}{Provide extra contrasts here.}

\item{annot_df}{Include some annotation information in the results?}

\item{force}{Force deseq to accept data which likely violates its assumptions.}

\item{keepers}{List of explicit contrasts to perform instead of all.}

\item{deseq_method}{The DESeq2 manual shows a few ways to invoke it, I make
2 of them available here.}

\item{fittype}{Method to fir the data.}

\item{...}{Triple dots!  Options are passed to arglist.}

\value{
List including the following information:
 run = the return from calling DESeq()
 denominators = list of denominators in the contrasts
 numerators = list of the numerators in the contrasts
 conditions = the list of conditions in the experiment
 coefficients = list of coefficients making the contrasts
 all_tables = list of DE tables
}
\description{
Invoking DESeq2 is confusing, this should help.
}
\details{
Like the other _pairwise() functions, this attempts to perform all pairwise
contrasts in the provided data set.  The details are of course slightly
different when using DESeq2.  Thus, this uses the function
choose_binom_dataset() to try to ensure that the incoming data is appropriate
for DESeq2 (if one normalized the data, it will attempt to revert to raw
counts, for example). It continues on to extract the conditions and batches
in the data, choose an appropriate experimental model, and run the DESeq
analyses as described in the manual.  It defaults to using an experimental
batch factor, but will accept a string like 'sva' instead, in which case it
will use sva to estimate the surrogates, and append them to the experimental
design.  The deseq_method parameter may be used to apply different DESeq2
code paths as outlined in the manual.  If you want to play with non-standard
data, the force argument will round the data and shoe-horn it into DESeq2.
