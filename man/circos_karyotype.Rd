\description{
This function tries to save me from having to get the lengths of arcs for
bacterial chromosomes manually correct, and writes them as a circos
compatible karyotype file. The outfile parameter was chosen to match the
configuration directive outlined in circos_prefix(), however that will need
to be changed in order for this to work in variable conditions.  Next time I
make one of these graphs I will do that I suspect. In addition, this
currently only understands how to write bacterial chromosomes, that will
likely be fixed when I am asked to write out a L.major karyotype. These
defaults were chosen because I have a chromosome of this length that is
correct.
