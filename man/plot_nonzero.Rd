\arguments{
\item{data}{Expt, expressionset, or dataframe.}

\item{design}{Eesign matrix.}

\item{colors}{Color scheme.}

\item{plot_labels}{How do you want to label the graph? 'fancy' will use
directlabels() to try to match the labels with the positions without
overlapping anything else will just stick them on a 45' offset next to the
graphed point.}

\item{expt_names}{Column or character list of preferred sample names.}

\item{max_overlaps}{Permit this many labels to overlap before dropping some.}

\item{label_chars}{How many characters for sample names before abbreviation.}

\item{plot_legend}{Print a legend for this plot?}

\item{plot_title}{Add a title?}

\item{cutoff}{Minimum proportion (or number) of genes below which samples might be in trouble.}

\item{...}{rawr!}
}
\value{
a ggplot2 plot of the number of non-zero genes with respect to each
 library's CPM.
}
\description{
This puts the number of genes with > 0 hits on the y-axis and CPM on the
x-axis. Made by Ramzi Temanni <temanni at umd dot edu>.
