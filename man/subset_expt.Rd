\title{Extract a subset of samples following some rule(s) from an
experiment class.}
\usage{
subset_expt(
  expt,
  subset = NULL,
  ids = NULL,
  nonzero = NULL,
  coverage = NULL,
  print_excluded = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{expt}{Expt chosen to extract a subset of data.}

\item{subset}{Valid R expression which defines a subset of the design to keep.}

\item{ids}{List of sample IDs to extract.}

\item{nonzero}{Look for a minimal number of nonzero genes.}

\item{coverage}{Request a minimum coverage/sample rather than text-based subset.}

\item{print_excluded}{Print out the samples which are removed via this filter?}
}
\value{
metadata Expt class which contains the smaller set of data.
}
\description{
Sometimes an experiment has too many parts to work with conveniently, this
operation allows one to break it into smaller pieces.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
 smaller_expt <- expt_subset(big_expt, "condition=='control'")
 all_expt <- expt_subset(expressionset, "")  ## extracts everything
}
