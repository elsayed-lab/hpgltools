\title{Use createDataPartition to create test/train sets and massage them a little.}
\usage{
create_partitions(
  full_df,
  interesting_meta,
  outcome_factor = "condition",
  p = 0.4,
  list = FALSE,
  times = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{full_df}{Dataframe containing the measured data and relevant factors.}

\item{interesting_meta}{Other metadata (maybe not needed)}

\item{outcome_factor}{Name of the outcome column}

\item{p}{Ratio to split trainer and testers.}

\item{list}{Generate result as list or dataframe}

\item{times}{How many times to iterate}
}
\description{
This will also do some massaging of the data to make it easier to work with for
downstream tasks.  Most notably, since I am mostly evaluating classifiers of
clinical data to see how well they agree with extant annotations, I want to make sure
the relevant columns are renamed in the testing sets.
