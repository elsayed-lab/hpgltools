# TODO list

* 202309: write_expt(), check the design rank before calling
  simple_varpart() and/or add some logic to simple_varpart() so that
  it a) does not trip over non-filtered data and b) nor non-qr passing
  models.
* 202309: Finish creating methods and removing all the various
  if(class()) stanzas.
