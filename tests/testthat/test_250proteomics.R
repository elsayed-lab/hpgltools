## I would like to test out my various proteomics functions.  Unfortunately,
## many of those functions require rather large input files.  So, I made a
## tarfile of the smallest of them in order to play with some of the
## functionality.

## As a reminder to myself, the general process followed is: (check out my
## 02_preprocessing*.Rmd for more details))
##  1.  Convert the thermo-fisher proprietary output files to mzXML/mzML using
##      MSreader on a windows virtual machine.
##  2.  Create a spectral library in the pqp format.  This may either be created
##      from an existing DDA experiment, or from some downloaded data.  Let us
##      assume the latter for the moment, then the command is
##      'TargetedFileConverter'
##  3.  Check over the mzXML/mzML files to ensure that there are no problems so
##      significant that they will cause later steps to fail. (That is what the
##      first few functions help with)
##  4.  Write appropriate window files for OpenSwathWorkflow, the function
##      'extract_msraw_data()' will do that for you, but it requires the rather
##      large mzXML files which I don't want to include here.  So unless I find
##      a data package containing some, I guess you will have to trust me that
##      those parsers actually work.
##  5.  Pass the transition library and raw data files to OpenSwathWorkFlow.
##  6.  Run pyprophet on the openswath outputs to normalize the error rates.
##  7.  Examine the pyprophet outputs to see if there are problems.
##      extract_pyprophet_data() and related functions help with that.
##  8.  Invoke SWATH2stats to filter the data and create matrices in the formats
##      expected by MSstats etc.
##  9.  Conversely, take those matrices and pass them to hpgltools.
##  10. Conversely, pass the mzXML data directly to encylopeDIA and extract the
##      output matrices.

## For most of the above choices, I have functions in the hpgltools to help.

## As the name implies, this function uses the diascored column in the metadata
## and reads the pyprophet output files indicated therein; it parses them into a
## list of data tables which are later used for plotting/examining.
## In that list is 'failed, colors, metadata, and sample_data'.  Failed is
## comprised of the files which failed to read properly, colors are for
## plotting, metadata is a copy of the metadata, and sample_data is the fun.

## plot_pyprophet_counts has some parameters to ignore/include decoys
## as well as different types: 'protein_count' which counts how many proteins

## columnname was provided, assuming it was numeric.
peptide_identifications <- plot_pyprophet_counts(pyprophet_fun, keep_decoys = FALSE,

## widths with respect to counts are a surprisingly reliable way to find
## problematic samples.

                                       y_type = "leftwidth")
test_that("Does plot_pyprophet_xy return a plot?", {
  expect_equal(class(pyprophet_lwidths)[1], "gg")

## The above are global metrics, we can plot some metrics of individual
## proteins.  Any column from above may be used.

  expect_equal(class(intensities_esxG)[1], "gg")
})

## The final step of pyprophet is to export the individual matrices into a
## single table, that is the input for SWATH2stats.
## I have one function which helps with that, s2s_all_filters() which just
## invokes all of the SWATH2stats filters with some hopefully sane defaults.
