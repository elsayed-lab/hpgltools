## Note to self: Some recent changed to the creation of my expressionsets lead to changes in the order of the resulting data frames.
## This is intended to make it easier for me to keep track of what is happening to the data by forcing it into a consistent order.
## Sadly, this means that most of these tests fail because they assume the previous generic order of genes.  Thus I am now adding
## the gene names to the tests.
## Uses these genes for quick tests
