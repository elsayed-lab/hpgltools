## Some changes were made to the surrogate detectors in 2017-01/2016-12.  In at least one instance
## an error crept in.  In addition, in this time frame I added a hook to the batch_counts() function
## which allows it to call on get_model_adjust() when a batch adjustment method is actually in it.
## The result is a more flexible batch method, but sadly one which has/had at least one error.
